# ACTION-public
Public repository for the ACTION trial: Azithromycin for COVID-19 Treatment, Investigating Outpatients Nationwide

## Description

This repo includes the R code to complete all analyses for the article:

_Effect of Oral Azithromycin vs Placebo on COVID-219 Symptoms in Outpatients With SARS-CoV-2 Infection_, Oldenburg et al. _JAMA_ 2021. doi:10.1001/jama.2021.11517

This repo is mirrored on the Open Science Framework (OSF), where we have additionally archived the study's datasets and computational notebook output files: https://osf.io/ca3pe/

## To run the analyses

1. Clone this repository
2. Download the two analysis datasets from https://osf.io/ca3pe/. Save the datasets in a subdirectory named: `ACTION-public/data/public` 
3. Create a subdirectory to save the analysis output: `ACTION-public/output`
4. Run the `.Rmd` files in the  `ACTION-public/code/analysis` directory.  They will generate `.html` files in the output directory with the results.

We have archived the `.html` output files from the final analysis as associated files for release 1 of this repository and also on OSF.
